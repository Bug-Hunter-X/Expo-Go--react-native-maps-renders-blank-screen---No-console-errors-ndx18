The solution to this problem is highly context-dependent.  There isn't one single fix. However, here are examples of possible solutions to try.  The best approach often involves trying several of these strategies.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import MapView from 'react-native-maps';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

const MyMap = () => {
  const [region, setRegion] = useState({
    latitude: 37.78825,
    longitude: -122.4324,
    latitudeDelta: 0.0922,
    longitudeDelta: 0.0421,
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    // Check for location permissions and set region dynamically if needed
    // ... 
  }, []);

  return (
    <MapView style={{ flex: 1 }} region={region}>
      {/* Map Markers and other Map elements here */}
    </MapView>
  );
};

export default MyMap;
```

**Alternative Approach (If applicable)**

Consider using a different Map library if the above does not work.  While `react-native-maps` is a popular choice, other libraries may have better compatibility with Expo.

**Important Notes:**

* Ensure your Google Cloud Platform project is properly set up with the correct billing and API keys.
* Thoroughly check your code for any other potential issues unrelated to `react-native-maps` that could be interfering with rendering.  A blank screen can be a symptom of various problems.
