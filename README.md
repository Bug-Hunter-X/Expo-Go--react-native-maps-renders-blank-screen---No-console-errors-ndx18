# Expo Go: react-native-maps Blank Screen Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where the `react-native-maps` library fails to render a map in the Expo Go app.  The map component renders a blank screen, and there are no error messages in the console.  The API key is correctly configured, and other parts of the app work fine.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Run the app using Expo Go.
4. Observe the blank screen where the map should be rendered.  No error messages will appear in the console.

## Potential Causes and Solutions

The root cause of this problem is often subtle and difficult to diagnose. Potential solutions explored include:

* **API Key Verification:** Double-check that your Google Maps API key is properly configured and enabled for the required services (Maps SDK for Android and iOS).
* **Permissions:** Ensure necessary location permissions are granted.
* **Expo Go Limitations:** Some versions of Expo Go might have compatibility issues with `react-native-maps`. Consider testing on a physical device or using Expo's standalone build. 
* **Library Version Compatibility:** Check for compatibility issues between your `react-native-maps` version and other libraries or Expo version.
* **Package Update:** Make sure all packages are updated to their latest versions.

## Solution (If Applicable)

Sometimes, switching to a newer version of Expo, rebuilding the app as a standalone or testing it on a physical device resolves the problem. This repository also provides an example solution file (bugSolution.js) that demonstrates alternative configurations that might resolve the issue. This can include trying different map providers.
