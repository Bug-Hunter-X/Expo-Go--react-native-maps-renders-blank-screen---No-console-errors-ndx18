This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test an app that uses the react-native-maps library.  The map component renders a blank screen with no error messages in the console. This can happen even if the API key is correctly configured and the other components of the app are rendering correctly.  The error is particularly difficult to debug because of the lack of any explicit error messages.
